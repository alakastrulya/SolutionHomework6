# Solution Homework 6


This project demonstrates two design patterns: the Command Pattern in the Command package and the Chain of Responsibility Pattern in the ChainOfResponsibility package. The Command Pattern builds a smart home remote control system, controlling lights, thermostats, and curtains via a CLI menu with undo, redo, and macro commands like "Goodnight Mode" and "Good Morning Mode," improving usability with a simple interface, undo/redo, and macros, enhancing performance through efficient command execution, lightweight history using a Stack, and scalability, and boosting maintainability with decoupled design, extensibility, and clear code structure. The Chain of Responsibility Pattern creates a logging and support system, where LoggerChain handles log messages (mini, not mini, big) through EmailLogger, SMSLogger, and LoggerConsole, and SupportChain processes user issues (e.g., password reset, refund request) via FAQBotHandler, JuniorSupportHandler, and SeniorSupportHandler, enhancing usability by automatically routing requests to the right handler, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary checks with a linear chain, and increasing maintainability by allowing easy addition or removal of handlers (e.g., removing SMSLogger or JuniorSupportHandler) without changing the core logic. To run, clone the repo, open in an IDE, and run Main.java in each package to use the CLI menus. Learning these patterns prepares you for real-world development in enterprise software, mobile apps, and web platforms, teaching you to build user-friendly, efficient, and maintainable systems.
